/* FIXME/TBD:
 
 The following lower level functionality might be separated out into a separate class, covered by a separate test case class:
 - With no input, initial pose is standing, arms at side
 - Some single animation produces correct results at a given keyframe time.
 - Some single animation produces correct results at a given interpolated time.
 - Blend between two animations, started at separate times, produces correct result at a given interpolated time.
 - Head orientation can be overridden to produce change that doesn't come from the playing animation.
 - Hand position/orientation can be overridden to produce change that doesn't come from the playing animation.
 - Hand position/orientation can be overrridden to produce elbow change that doesn't come from the playing animation.
 - Respect scaling? (e.g., so that MyAvatar.increase/decreaseSize can alter rig, such that anti-scating and footfalls-on-stairs  works)

 Higher level functionality:
 - start/stopAnimation adds the animation to that which is playing, blending/fading as needed.
 - thrust causes walk role animation to be used.
 - turning causes turn role animation to be used. (two tests, correctly symmetric left & right)
 - walk/turn do not skate (footfalls match over-ground velocity)
 - (Later?) walk up stairs / hills have proper footfall for terrain
 - absence of above causes return to idle role animation to be used
 - (later?) The lower-level head/hand placements respect previous state. E.g., actual hand movement can be slower than requested.
 - (later) The lower-level head/hand placements can move whole skeleton. E.g., turning head past a limit may turn whole body. Reaching up can move shoulders and hips.
 
 Backward-compatability operations. We should think of this behavior as deprecated:
 - clearJointData return to standing. TBD: presumably with idle and all other animations NOT playing, until explicitly reenabled with a new TBD method?
 - setJointData applies the given data. Same TBD.
 These can be defined true or false, but the tests document the behavior and tells us if something's changed:
 - An external change to the original skeleton IS/ISN'T seen by the rig.
 - An external change to the original skeleton's head orientation IS/ISN'T seen by the rig.
 - An external change to the original skeleton's hand orientiation IS/ISN'T seen by the rig.
